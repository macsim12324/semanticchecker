# Role of a Syntax Analyzer in a Compiler

## Overview
The **syntax analyzer**, also known as the **parser**, is an important phase of a compiler.  
It checks whether the sequence of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer follows the **grammar rules** of the programming language.

---

## Main Roles of a Syntax Analyzer

### 1. Verify Syntactic Correctness
The syntax analyzer ensures that the program structure is correct according to the language grammar.  
It checks the proper arrangement and ordering of tokens.

---

### 2. Construct Parse Tree / Syntax Tree
It organizes tokens into a **parse tree** or **syntax tree**, which represents the hierarchical structure of the program.

---

### 3. Detect Syntax Errors
The parser detects syntax errors such as:
- Missing symbols
- Extra symbols
- Incorrect ordering of tokens

These errors are reported so they can be corrected.

### 4. Pass Structure to Semantic Analyzer
After successful parsing, the syntax analyzer passes the structured representation of the program to the **semantic analyzer** for further checks.

---

## Summary
In short, the syntax analyzer validates the grammatical structure of the program and prepares it for semantic analysis.
